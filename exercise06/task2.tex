$\forall_{i=1}^N : s_i = u_i^T y$ \\ \\
Show: $\sum_{i=1}^N s_i^2 = ||y||^2$

Let $U = [u_1 \ldots u_N]$, then we can rewrite the above condition with
\begin{equation}
s = U^T y
\end{equation}
where $s = [s_i \ldots s_N]^T$.

Now we can rearrange $\sum_{i=1}^N s_i^2$ esaily to give $||y||^2$.
\begin{gather*}
\sum_{i=1}^N s_i^2 = s^Ts = (U^T y)^T (U^T y) \\
= y^T U U^T y = y^Ty = ||y||^2
\end{gather*}
As we know that $U$ is an orthogonal matrix (because it columns are eigenvectors of $K$),
$U U^T = I $ where $I$ is the identity matrix.
