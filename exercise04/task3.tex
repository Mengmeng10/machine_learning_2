\section*{Task 3}

\subsection*{a}

\begin{gather*}
\frac{\partial E}{\partial V^T} = \sum^N_{i=1} 2(x_i - W V^T x_i) (-W x_i) \\
\end{gather*}
Therfore, deriving wrt. V:

\begin{gather*}
    \frac{\partial E}{\partial V} = \sum^N_{i=1} (2(x_i - W V^T x_i) (-W x_i)^T \\
    = -2 \sum^N_{i=1} (W x_i)^T (x_i - W V^T x_i)^T
\end{gather*}

\subsection*{b}

Before, we had to solve a optimization problem to find suitable sources. Now, we
can utilize the encoder network to find the source codes. As long as the
encoder network is small, we can find the codes more efficiently than by solving
the optimization problem. The computational costs grow linearly with the complexity
of the networks.
